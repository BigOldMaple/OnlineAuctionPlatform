/**
 * UserAccountPage Component (Planned)
 *
 * The `UserAccountPage` will serve as the central hub for users to manage their account
 * information and view their activity on the auction site. This page will display:
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - **Profile Information**: Users can view and possibly edit their basic account details
 *   (e.g., name, email, password).
 * - **Bid History**: A list of all auctions the user has participated in, including the
 *   items they have bid on, the amounts, and the dates of bids.
 * - **Watchlist**: An optional section where users can save auctions they are interested in,
 *   allowing them to monitor these items easily.
 * - **Account Settings**: Users may have options to update their password, enable notifications,
 *   and manage other account preferences.
 *
 * Future Enhancements:
 * - **Notifications**: Users could receive alerts for bids they have been outbid on,
 *   items they are watching, or auctions they have won.
 * - **Transaction History**: A record of completed transactions if the auction platform
 *   includes buying and payment functionalities.
 * - **User Dashboard**: A personalized summary of recent activity, including recommendations
 *   for new auctions based on past bids or watchlist items.
